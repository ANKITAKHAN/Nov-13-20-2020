* Create two components __Input.js__ and __Output.js__
* Input.js contains a button __Get time__
* Output.js contains a __h1__ where you display the current time

* We are going to make Input and Output talk to each other.
* When you click the button in Input component, current time should be displayed in the Output component

* Let's create a third component called __Parent.js__ which acts as a mediator between Input and Output
* Add Parent Component inside __App.js__ 


* Once you complete the above, let's discuss how to wire __Input and Output__ using props
